            EduConf is an unmissable event. The caliber of speakers was
            exceptional, and the connections I made with fellow educators have
            been invaluable for my research and teaching practices. I'm already
            looking forward to next year.

            The sessions on AI and instructional design were incredibly
            insightful. I left with a wealth of new ideas and practical tools to
            implement in our platform. It’s the most forward-thinking conference
            in the EdTech space.

            As a graduate student, attending was a game-changer. The workshops
            were practical, and being able to connect with leading researchers
            in my field was inspiring. I feel energized and more connected to
            the academic community.
